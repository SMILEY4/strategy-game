Ideas new system

- population-amount more "civilisation"-like
    - 1 pop =/= 1 person
    - 1 pop = 1 population/size-tier => does not have to scale e.g. linearly
    - easier for player to understand: "5 pop city vs 10 pop city" VS "184 pop city vs 19520 pop city"
    - easier to design functions for -> less range in scale "1-100" vs 1-100000"

- growth/decline
    - each pop-type in each city has a growth-meter
        - reaches +100% -> new pop spawns
        - reaches -100% -> one pop dies
    - fill up meter over time via
        - base rate
        - food surplus/security
        - social class
        - ...
    - decrease meter over time via
        - food deficiency/famine
        - plague
        - low sanitation
        - social class
        - ...

- types
    - peasants
    - craftsmen
    - nobility

- settlement evolution
    - starts with 1 peasant pop
        - used for farm-buildings, and "simple" crafts
        - if valid workspace < pops (peasants):
            - subsidized farms -> little impact on eco
    - if workspace with more complex crafts (e.g. armory, ...)
        - if valid workspace < pops (craftsmen)
            - pops (craftsmen) migrate to city with free workspace
            - pops (craftsmen) become peasants
        - if valid workspace > pops (craftsmen)
            - "unemployed" peasants can become craftsmen
    - if economy of city large enough
        - nobility-pop can spawn



SIMULATION STEP

- for each city
    - for each building
        - grab matching workers
        - if workers missing: convert subsistence farmers to employee -> convert to matching pop
    - unemployed pops become either subsistence farmers or migrate to other/better city


    - for each building
        - produce and handle resources (see buildings)



FARM

- produces x food
- if no noble present
    - food goes 100% to peasants
- if noble is present
    - food goes 60% to peasants
    - food goes 40% to noble

IRON MINE

- produces x metal
- if no noble present
    - metal goes 100% to peasants
- if noble is present
    - metal goes 100% to noble
    - peasants are paid by noble (70% of market price)


FOREST

- produces x wood
- if no noble present
    - wood goes 100% to peasants
- if noble is present
    - wood goes 100% to noble
    - peasants are paid by noble (70% of market price)
