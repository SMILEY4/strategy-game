REMOTE STATE

- contains whole game state retrieved from backend.
    - e.g. all tiles
    - does not contain any modifications done by the player (during a turn)

=> optimized for efficient reads
    - complex (nested) structures optimized for queries (e.g. maps)
    - only updated all at once - never only parts of state
    - updated rarely - only once at start of turn
    - large
