LOCAL STATE

- contains general state that does not need to be synced with game state (e.g. user authentication)
- contains all modifications applied by the player to the game state
    - e.g. commands
    - NOT the game state itself (e.g. list of tiles)

=> optimized for many writes / modifications
    - small
    - updated/modified regularly
    - flat structure
    - split into different states to reduce unwanted updates
   (- does not need to be read-efficient, since data to filter is relatively small)
