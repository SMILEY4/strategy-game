TODO:

- cleanup models (only one module should own any one model)

- where to place db-entities -> owned by a module ?

- models (city, tile, province, ...) owned by gameengine ?   -> "core" gameengine models, only borrowed by others

- move dto-creation into gameengine ?
    -> all models owned by gameengine + contains core-game-logic regarding e.g. visibility, ...
    -> rename to e.g. player-view-models, ...
