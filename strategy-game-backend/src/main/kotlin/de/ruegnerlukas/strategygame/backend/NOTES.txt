TODO:

- cleanup models (only one module should own any one model)
- where to place db-entities -> owned by a module ?
- replace List, Set, ... with generic collections where possible / at interfaces
- models (city, tile, province, ...) owned by gameengine ?   -> "core" gameengine models, only borrowed by others
- move dto-creation into gameengine ?
    -> all models owned by gameengine + contains core-game-logic regarding e.g. visibility, ...
    -> rename to e.g. player-view-models, ...
- rework command model structure
    - command vs instruction ?
        - command is what the player sends (gamesession) -> gets validated, enhanced and "optimized"
        - instruction is what the game processes (gameengine)
        -> where commandresolution ?!?!?!?
